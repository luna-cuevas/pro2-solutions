## My process

Pro2 solutions approached me through Upwork to design and build their company's new website. I used Figma, photoshop, and illustrator to conceptualize a design based on a sketch provided by the client. I then worked with the client to create a mockup of the website, hook up their emailjs account to create a contact form, and optimize the website for search engines.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to export the app into static pages so that the client could upload the website to their own server.
